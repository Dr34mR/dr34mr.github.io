So - I kind of knew that I was interested in hosting a 'blog' directly on my own GitHub but it wasn't something that I can say that I was activley looking into.

Still got a bunch of config to adjust, set up a propper root URL, as well as looking at implementing some CSS.

Who knew I could fork a repo that others already had set up to get myself off the ground.

If you have your own GitHub and want to turn your home page into a Blog head over to to the [Jekyll Now repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to get started.
