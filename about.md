I'm a TRIM / Content Manager consultant and software developer who has been working with, and supporting the Content Manager product in a professional capacity for 12+ years.

Over that time I've performed upgrades, migrations, architecture designs, built applications, API's, services, carried out health checks, business analysis, implemented workflows, electronic approvals, audits, you name it.

I have worked on small datasets supporting tens of individuals, all the way up to datasets supporting tens of thousands.

This blog contains my ramblings as well as tips and tricks I've discovered throughout the course of my work.
